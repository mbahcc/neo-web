            I joined neo during my freshman year at the advice of a colleague.
            Now looking back, I'm incredibly grateful I did. Over the past two
            years, neo has easily been the most impactful organization I've been
            a part of at the University of Cincinnati. What really drew me
            towards neo is how tangible the work is. Weâ€™re helping actual
            businesses navigate real world challenges. Applying what I've
            learned through neo to make a difference in the community has been
            both humbling and empowering. But to me, neo is more than a
            consulting club, it's a community. Some of the most driven,
            thoughtful, and inspiring people I've met are from neo. The
            mentorship and guidance I've received from my peers all play a huge
            role in my personal and professional growth. Neo has opened doors
            for me, challenged me, and supported me every step of the way.
